# Ecosystem Ideas

Welcome to the Ecosystem Ideas by the Mina Foundation! 

This repository serves as a collection of ideas and projects that can be built on the Mina protocol using the [o1js](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js) library. The ideas span various categories, including research, zkApps, and cryptographic primitives. Some concepts may be fully developed, while others are just initial seeds waiting to grow. 

We hope that this inspires you to create the next generation of innovative applications.
